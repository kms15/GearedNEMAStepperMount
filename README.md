# KosselExtruderHolder
This is a mount for a geared NEMA 17 stepper motor.  Equivalently, it is a
holder for the extruder like that on the Kossel mini 3D printer, but unlike the
stock Kossel design it does not use zip ties.  If you like being able to
disassemble and reassemble parts of your printer without worrying if you have
extra zip ties on hand, you might prefer to use this extruder holder instead of
the stock extruder holder.

## Required hardware
 - 3 Socket Headed Cap Screws, M3x8mm
 - 1 Socket Headed Cap Screw, M3x22mm (or longer)
 - 4 hex nuts, M3

## Assembly
 1. Print out KosselExtruderHolder.stl and clean up the part as needed.
 2. Place the M3x22mm screw through the two holes on either side of the gap
    in the ring and loosely thread an M3 nut onto the end of the screw.  The
    head of the screw should go in the round side and the nut in the hexagonal
    side.
 3. Place the three M3x8mm screws through the three vertical holes, and loosely
    thread an M3 nut onto each.
 4. Slide the three M3 nuts on the M3x8mm screws into the outside slot of one
    of the vertical aluminum extrusions with the ring side of the part facing
    down.  Slide to the desired position and tighten the M3x8mm screws to hold
    in place.
 5. Put the gear box of the geared stepper motor (without the extruder
    attached) through the middle of the ring, with the shaft of the stepper
    motor facing upwards, and tighten the M3x22mm screw to hold in place.
 6. Attach the extruder to the stepper motor.
