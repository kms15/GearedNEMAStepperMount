# KosselExtruderHolder
This is a mount for a geared NEMA 17 stepper motor.  Equivalently,
it is a holder for the extruder like that on the Kossel mini 3D
printer, but unlike the stock Kossel design it does not use zip ties.
If you like being able to disassemble and reassemble parts of your printer
without worrying if you have extra zip ties on hand, you might prefer this
to the stock extruder holder.

## Required hardware
 - 3 Socket Headed Cap Screws, M3x8mm
 - 1 Socket Headed Cap Screw, M3x22mm (or longer)
 - 4 hex nuts, M3

## Assembly
 1. Print out KosselExtruderHolder.stl and clean up the part as needed.
 2. Place the M3x22mm screw through the two holes on either side of the gap
    in the ring and loosely secure with an M3 nut.  The socket head should
    go in the round side, and the nut in the hexagonal side.
 3. Place the 3 M3x8mm screws through the three vertical holes, and loosely
    thread an M3 nut onto each.
 4. Slide the 3 M3 nuts on the M3x8mm screws into the slot on one of the
    vertical aluminum extrusions with the ring side of the part facing down.
    Slide to the desired position and tighten the M3x8mm screws to hold in
    place.
 5. Put the gear box of the geared stepper motor (without the extruder
    attached), with the shaft facing upwards through the middle of the ring,
    and tighten the M3x22mm screw to hold in place.
 6. Attach the extruder to the stepper motor.
